# 🌱 Plants Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

The **Plants Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project designed to help users explore and gain insights from plant-related data. With dynamic visualizations, trend analyses, and KPIs, this dashboard allows for easy monitoring and comparison of plant growth, health, and care metrics.

**Key Highlights:**

* Interactive charts and graphs for real-time exploration
* Trend analysis of plant metrics over time
* Dynamic filters for customized views
* KPIs for quick, actionable insights

## Dataset

The dashboard leverages a plant dataset with the following key attributes:

* **Plant Name / Species**
* **Growth Parameters** (height, age, growth rate, etc.)
* **Health Indicators** (disease status, leaf color, etc.)
* **Care Metrics** (watering frequency, sunlight requirements, soil type, etc.)


## Features

* **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore data by hovering, clicking, and filtering.
* **Trend Analysis**: Track changes in growth or health metrics over time.
* **KPIs**: Quickly monitor important plant metrics.
* **Data Insights**: Identify patterns and correlations in plant health and care.
* **User-Friendly Design**: Clean and intuitive layout for easy navigation.
* **Advanced Analytics (DAX)**: Custom measures and calculations for deeper insights.
* **Mobile Optimization**: Layouts suitable for mobile devices for on-the-go access.
